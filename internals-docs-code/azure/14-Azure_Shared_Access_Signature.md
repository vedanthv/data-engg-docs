## Shared Access Signatures in Azure

---

## üîπ What is a SAS?

A **Shared Access Signature (SAS)** is like a **temporary key with limited permissions** that you can give to someone (or an app) so they can access your Azure Storage resources **without sharing your account keys**.

* Your **storage account keys** = the **master key** to the whole house.
* A **SAS token** = a **guest pass** to just one room, for a limited time.

---

## üîπ Types of SAS

1. **Account SAS**

   * Grants access to services at the **account level**.
   * Can apply to: Blob, File, Queue, Table.
   * Example: ‚ÄúGive read/write to all blob containers for 2 hours.‚Äù

2. **Service SAS**

   * Grants access to a **specific resource** (like one blob, or one file share).
   * Example: ‚ÄúUser can download just this one blob until midnight.‚Äù

3. **User Delegation SAS**

   * Created using **Azure AD credentials** instead of account key.
   * More secure because you avoid using storage account keys.
   * Example: ‚ÄúAn app logged in with Azure AD gets a SAS for one blob.‚Äù

---

## üîπ What can you control with a SAS?

* **Permissions**

  * Read (`r`), Write (`w`), Delete (`d`), List (`l`), Add, Create, Update.
* **Start time and expiry time**

  * Define when the SAS is valid.
* **Resource scope**

  * Container, Blob, File, Queue, Table.
* **IP address restrictions**

  * Limit access to certain IP ranges.
* **Protocol restrictions**

  * Allow HTTPS only (recommended).

---

## üîπ SAS Structure

A SAS is basically a **token string** you append to a resource URL.
Example:

```
https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myfile.txt?sv=2023-11-14&ss=b&srt=o&sp=r&se=2025-09-05T10:00Z&st=2025-09-05T08:00Z&spr=https&sig=abcd1234
```

Parts:

* `sv` ‚Üí Storage version.
* `ss` ‚Üí Services.
* `srt` ‚Üí Resource types.
* `sp` ‚Üí Permissions.
* `st` / `se` ‚Üí Start/Expiry time.
* `sig` ‚Üí The cryptographic signature.

---

## üîπ How to create SAS

### Option 1: **Azure Portal**

* Go to your Storage Account ‚Üí **Shared access signature** ‚Üí Choose permissions, expiry, allowed IP ‚Üí Generate SAS token.

### Option 2: **Azure Storage Explorer**

* Right-click container/blob ‚Üí Get Shared Access Signature.

### Option 3: **Azure CLI**

```sh
az storage blob generate-sas \
  --account-name mystorageaccount \
  --container-name mycontainer \
  --name myfile.txt \
  --permissions r \
  --expiry 2025-09-05T10:00Z \
  --https-only \
  --output tsv
```

### Option 4: **SDK (Python example)**

```python
from azure.storage.blob import generate_blob_sas, BlobSasPermissions
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

sas_token = generate_blob_sas(
    account_name="mystorageaccount",
    container_name="mycontainer",
    blob_name="myfile.txt",
    account_key="your_storage_key",
    permission=BlobSasPermissions(read=True),
    expiry=datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)
)

print("SAS Token:", sas_token)
```

---

## üîπ Best Practices

* Use **User Delegation SAS** with Azure AD when possible.
* Keep expiry times short (principle of least privilege).
* Use **stored access policies** if you need to revoke SAS without waiting for expiry.
* Restrict to HTTPS and specific IP ranges.

---

## üîπ Shared Access Signatures (SAS)

* **What it is**: A **signed token** you append to a storage resource URL (e.g., blob, file, queue).
* **How it works**:

  * Signed with the storage account key (or via Azure AD for user delegation SAS).
  * Grants specific **permissions (R/W/D/L)** for a **time window**.
  * Passed around as part of a URL.

üëâ Think: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a **temporary guest pass** to this file/container.‚Äù

**Pros:**

* Very flexible (can be scoped down to one blob, for 5 minutes).
* Easy to share (just a URL).
* No need for caller to authenticate with Azure AD.

**Cons:**

* Hard to revoke (unless you use **stored access policies**).
* If leaked, anyone with the token can use it until it expires.
* Still relies on account keys (for Service SAS / Account SAS).

---

## üîπ Managed Identities (MI)

* **What it is**: An **Azure AD identity** automatically managed by Azure for your resource (VM, Function, App Service, Databricks, etc.).
* **How it works**:

  * Resource (e.g., Databricks cluster) has a system-assigned or user-assigned identity.
  * Identity is trusted by Azure AD.
  * When the resource needs to access storage, it requests a token from Azure AD using its MI.
  * Access is controlled via **Azure RBAC** (e.g., ‚ÄúBlob Data Reader‚Äù).

üëâ Think: ‚ÄúThe **building security system** recognizes you because you‚Äôre wearing your office badge.‚Äù

**Pros:**

* No secrets, no SAS tokens, no keys to manage.
* Access controlled centrally by **Azure RBAC**.
* Tokens are short-lived and auto-rotated.
* More secure for long-running apps (no risk of token leaks in code).

**Cons:**

* Less flexible for **fine-grained sharing** (you can‚Äôt say ‚Äúgive access to just this one blob for 15 minutes‚Äù).
* Requires the caller to run inside Azure (VM, Function, App Service, Databricks, etc.).

## üîπ When to use what

| Scenario                                               | Use SAS | Use Managed Identity |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------- |
| Share a file with an external partner                  | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚ùå No                 |
| Grant temporary access to a single blob/container      | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚ùå No                 |
| Long-running Azure app accessing storage               | ‚ùå No    | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| Secure, keyless access with automatic token rotation   | ‚ùå No    | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| Fine-grained, time-limited access without RBAC changes | ‚úÖ Yes   | ‚ùå No                 |

---

‚úÖ **Summary**:

* **SAS** = best for **short-term, fine-grained, external sharing** (like ‚Äúdownload this blob until tonight‚Äù).
* **Managed Identity** = best for **apps running in Azure** that need **ongoing secure access** without key management.

Great question ‚Äî in **Azure Storage**, there are three types of **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** you can use to delegate access. They differ in how they‚Äôre issued, what keys/identities they rely on, and their typical use cases. Let‚Äôs break them down clearly:

---

## 1. **Account SAS**

* **What it is:** Grants access to resources **in one entire storage account** (across multiple services like Blob, File, Queue, Table).
* **How it‚Äôs created:**

  * Signed with the **storage account key**.
  * Generated by someone who has the account key (usually admins or automation).
* **Scope:**

  * Can allow access to **any service** in the account.
  * Example: grant access to all blobs + queues in that storage account.
* **Use case:**

  * When you want broad access across multiple services in one storage account (e.g., backup apps).

---

## 2. **Service SAS**

* **What it is:** Grants access to **one specific service** (Blob, File, Queue, or Table) in the storage account.
* **How it‚Äôs created:**

  * Also signed with the **storage account key**.
* **Scope:**

  * Limited to one service and possibly a narrower scope (e.g., one container or even one blob).
* **Use case:**

  * When you want fine-grained control over access.
  * Example: give a client app permission to upload to a single blob container, but nothing else.

---

## 3. **User Delegation SAS**

* **What it is:** Grants access to **Blob storage only**, but signed with an **Azure AD identity** (user, group, service principal, or managed identity).
* **How it‚Äôs created:**

  * You first obtain a **User Delegation Key** by authenticating with Azure AD.
  * Then you use that key to create the SAS.
* **Scope:**

  * Blob containers or blobs.
  * Access is tied to **Azure AD role assignments + RBAC**.
* **Use case:**

  * When you don‚Äôt want to use account keys (better security, least privilege).
  * Example: a web app authenticated with Azure AD issues SAS tokens for users to securely upload files to Blob storage.

## üîë Key Differences

| Feature            | Account SAS                    | Service SAS                                 | User Delegation SAS                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signed with**    | Storage account key            | Storage account key                         | Azure AD (via user delegation key)                         |
| **Scope**          | All services in account        | Single service (Blob/File/Queue/Table)      | Blob storage only                                          |
| **Security model** | Key-based                      | Key-based                                   | Identity-based (Azure AD + RBAC)                           |
| **Granularity**    | Broad                          | More fine-grained                           | Fine-grained + tied to identity                            |
| **Best use case**  | Admin apps needing wide access | Client/service access to specific resources | Apps/users where security and least privilege are critical |

## üìù Example Scenarios

* **Account SAS:**
  A backup tool needs access to **all blobs and queues** in a storage account.
* **Service SAS:**
  A partner app should only write into **one blob container** but not see others.
* **User Delegation SAS:**
  A web portal where users log in with **Azure AD** and get temporary SAS tokens to upload their files ‚Äî no account keys exposed.
