# Azure Private Endpoints

# 🔒 What is an Azure Private Endpoint?

* A **private endpoint** is a **network interface** in your **Virtual Network (VNet)** that connects you privately and securely to an Azure service.
* Instead of accessing the service (e.g., Storage, SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Key Vault) via a **public IP**, traffic flows through a **private IP** inside your VNet.
* Uses **Azure Private Link** technology.

---

# 🛠 How It Works

1. You create a **Private Endpoint** for a resource (like a Storage Account).
2. Azure assigns a **private IP** from your VNet to this endpoint.
3. Your VNet traffic → goes through this private IP → securely reaches the Azure service → without leaving Microsoft’s backbone network.
4. The service’s **public endpoint is still there**, but you can restrict/block it.

---

# 📂 Example: Azure Storage with Private Endpoint

* You have a Storage Account `mystorage.blob.core.windows.net`.
* Normally, you’d connect via the public internet using that FQDN.
* With a **Private Endpoint**, Azure will map:

```
mystorage.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net → 10.1.0.5  (private IP inside your VNet)
```

* So apps in your VNet access Storage **via private IP**.
* You can then **disable all public access** to the Storage Account for max security.

---

# ✅ Benefits

* **Security**: No public internet exposure.
* **Compliance**: Meets strict data residency/security requirements.
* **Integration**: Works with Azure PaaS (Storage, SQL, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, etc.) and your own services behind Azure Standard Load Balancer.

---

# ⚙️ Configuration Steps (High-Level)

1. **Create a VNet & Subnet**.
2. **Create a Private Endpoint**:

   * Choose target service (e.g., Storage Account → Blob).
   * Pick the VNet + subnet.
   * A NIC with private IP gets created.
3. **Update DNS**:

   * Ensure the service FQDN resolves to the private IP (via Azure Private DNS Zone).
4. **Restrict Public Access**:

   * Disable public network access on the resource.

# 🚀 Azure CLI Example

```bash
# Create Private Endpoint for Storage Account
az network private-endpoint create \
  --name mystorage-pe \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet mySubnet \
  --private-connection-resource-id $(az storage account show -n mystorage -g myResourceGroup --query id -o tsv) \
  --group-id blob \
  --connection-name mystorage-connection

# Link Private DNS Zone
az network private-dns zone create -g myResourceGroup -n "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"
az network private-dns link vnet create -g myResourceGroup -n "link-myvnet" -z "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net" -v myVNet -e true
```

# 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

* Connect Azure SQL Database from on-prem → via ExpressRoute/VPN + private endpoint (no internet).
* Secure Azure Storage for Databricks / Synapse pipelines.
* Access Key Vault privately from inside a VNet.

### Easier Explanation

In **Azure**, a **Private Endpoint** is a **network interface** that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by **Azure Private Link**.

Instead of accessing services over the public internet, a private endpoint lets you access them through your **virtual network (VNet)** using **private IP addresses**.

---

### 🔑 Key Points

1. **Private IP** – The service (e.g., Azure Storage, SQL Database, Key Vault, etc.) gets a private IP inside your VNet.
2. **No Public Exposure** – Traffic stays within the Microsoft backbone network instead of going over the internet.
3. **DNS Integration** – You use private DNS zones so that service names (e.g., `mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net`) resolve to the private IP.
4. **Secure Access** – Only resources in your VNet (or peered VNets) can connect to the service.
5. **Isolation** – You can disable all public access to the service and allow only private endpoint traffic.

---

### ✅ Example Scenarios

* **Azure Storage Account**: Instead of accessing a blob container over the internet, a private endpoint gives your VM a private IP connection.
* **Azure SQL Database**: Applications inside your VNet can connect privately without opening public firewall rules.
* **Azure Key Vault**: Secrets can be retrieved over a private IP, protecting against data exfiltration.

---

### 📊 How it works

1. You create a **Private Endpoint** in your VNet.
2. Azure assigns a **private IP** from your VNet to that endpoint.
3. When your application resolves the service’s FQDN, it gets the private IP (via DNS configuration).
4. The traffic routes securely through **Azure Private Link** (Microsoft backbone).

---

👉 Think of it like this:
Instead of going out to the internet and back into Azure services, **Private Endpoints bring the service into your VNet** using a private IP.

### Private Endpoints vs Serivce Endpoints

Perfect question 👍 — this comes up a lot in interviews. Let’s break it down:

---

## 🔹 **Private Endpoint vs. Service Endpoint**

| Feature             | **Private Endpoint**                                                                         | **Service Endpoint**                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connectivity**    | Connects to the service using a **private IP** inside your VNet.                             | Extends your **VNet identity** to the service’s public IP. Traffic still flows to the service’s public endpoint.                  |
| **Security**        | Service can be locked down to **only allow private endpoints** → No public exposure.         | Service is still reachable on the public internet, but limited to specific **VNet/subnet(s)**.                                    |
| **Traffic Path**    | Goes through **Azure backbone via Private Link** → never leaves the Microsoft network.       | Still reaches the service’s **public endpoint**, but Azure ensures it stays on the backbone (doesn’t traverse the open internet). |
| **DNS Requirement** | Needs DNS zone integration so service FQDN resolves to the **private IP**.                   | No DNS changes needed (uses public IP).                                                                                           |
| **Granularity**     | Works at the **instance level** (e.g., a specific storage account, SQL DB, Key Vault).       | Works at the **service level** (all storage accounts in a region, etc.).                                                          |
| **Access Control**  | You can **disable public access** completely and force all traffic through private endpoint. | Public access is still available unless explicitly restricted.                                                                    |
| **Cost**            | Additional cost for Private Link/Private Endpoint.                                           | No extra cost (free).                                                                                                             |
| **Use Cases**       | High-security workloads, regulatory compliance, zero-trust architectures.                    | Simpler setup when you just want secure connectivity without exposing entire internet.                                            |

### 📌 Example

* If you have an **Azure SQL Database**:

  * **Private Endpoint** → Your app in VNet connects to SQL over a **private IP**. You can block all public access.
  * **Service Endpoint** → Your app connects over SQL’s **public IP**, but Azure recognizes it’s coming from your VNet and allows it.

---

👉 In short:

* **Private Endpoint = Private IP, highest security, service instance–level**.
* **Service Endpoint = Public IP, simpler, service-level restriction**.

---

### Analogy

Great — let’s make this real-world and easy to remember 👇

---

### 🏠 **Analogy: Private Endpoint vs Service Endpoint**

#### **Private Endpoint (VIP Door Inside Your House)**

* Imagine you hire a bank (Azure service) to keep your valuables.
* Instead of visiting their **public branch office** (internet), the bank builds a **special private door inside your house** that directly connects to your locker.
* Only you (inside your house / VNet) can use it.
* Outsiders can’t even see the locker’s public branch anymore (because you can disable public access).
* More secure, but costs extra (you’re paying for that VIP private door).

---

#### **Service Endpoint (Fast Lane to the Bank Branch)**

* You still go to the **public branch office** (public IP of service).
* But the bank recognizes you as a **VIP customer from your gated community (VNet/subnet)**.
* They let you skip the long queue and give you a secure corridor directly into the branch.
* Others can still access the branch (public access remains).
* Free and simpler, but less private than the “door inside your house.”

---

### 🎯 Quick Mnemonic

* **Private Endpoint = Private Door (service inside your VNet)**
* **Service Endpoint = VIP Lane (still public, just secured to your VNet)**

---

## Example

Great question — let’s go through an **Azure Private Link example** step by step.

---

# 🔹 What is Azure Private Link?

Azure **Private Link** lets you **access Azure services over a private IP address inside your Virtual Network (VNet)**.

* Without Private Link → your app connects to a **public endpoint** (internet-exposed).
* With Private Link → your app connects to a **private endpoint** (private IP in your VNet), but traffic still reaches the Azure service securely over Microsoft’s backbone network.

---

# 🔹 Example Scenario

You have:

* An **App VM** in a Virtual Network.
* An **Azure Storage Account**.

👉 You want the VM to connect to the storage account securely **without going over the public internet**.

---

# 🔹 Step-by-Step Setup

## 1. Create a VNet + VM

```bash
# Create resource group
az group create -n myRG -l eastus

# Create VNet + subnet
az network vnet create \
  --name myVNet \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --subnet-name mySubnet \
  --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24

# Create VM in VNet (Linux example)
az vm create \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --name myVM \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet mySubnet
```

---

## 2. Create a Storage Account

```bash
az storage account create \
  --name mystoragepldemo \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --location eastus \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --kind StorageV2
```

---

## 3. Create a Private Endpoint

This links the storage account to your VNet with a private IP.

```bash
az network private-endpoint create \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --name myPrivateEndpoint \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet mySubnet \
  --private-connection-resource-id $(az storage account show \
        --name mystoragepldemo \
        --resource-group myRG \
        --query "id" -o tsv) \
  --group-id blob \
  --connection-name myConnection
```

* `--group-id blob` → connects specifically to Blob service.
* A private IP (like `10.0.1.4`) is assigned inside `mySubnet`.

---

## 4. Configure Private DNS

Private endpoints require DNS to resolve the storage account name to the **private IP**.

```bash
az network private-dns zone create \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --name "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"

az network private-dns link vnet create \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --zone-name "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net" \
  --name MyDNSLink \
  --virtual-network myVNet \
  --registration-enabled false

az network private-endpoint dns-zone-group create \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --endpoint-name myPrivateEndpoint \
  --name MyZoneGroup \
  --private-dns-zone "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net" \
  --zone-name "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"
```

Now, `mystoragepldemo.blob.core.windows.net` resolves to the **private IP (10.0.x.x)** inside your VNet.

A Record `mystorageacct.blob.core.windows.net → 10.0.1.4` created in the DNS

---

## 5. Test from VM

SSH into the VM:

```bash
ssh azureuser@<public-ip-of-vm>
```

Test DNS resolution:

```bash
nslookup mystoragepldemo.blob.core.windows.net
```

✅ Should resolve to `10.0.1.x` (private IP).

Test connectivity:

```bash
curl https://mystoragepldemo.blob.core.windows.net/
```

Traffic goes through the private endpoint, not the public internet.

---

# 🔹 Real-World Uses

* **Databricks accessing ADLS Gen2** over private link.
* **SQL Database private endpoint** to keep DB off the public internet.
* **Key Vault private endpoint** so secrets are only accessible in-VNet.
* **App Service → Storage Account** private integration.

---

# 🔹 Key Benefits

* Removes exposure to public internet.
* Simplifies network security (no IP whitelisting).
* Uses Microsoft’s backbone network for traffic.
* Works with Azure Monitor logs to track connections.
