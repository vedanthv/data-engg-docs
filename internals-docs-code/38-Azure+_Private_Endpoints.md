# Azure Private Endpoints

# 🔒 What is an Azure Private Endpoint?

* A **private endpoint** is a **network interface** in your **Virtual Network (VNet)** that connects you privately and securely to an Azure service.
* Instead of accessing the service (e.g., Storage, SQL Database, Cosmos DB, Key Vault) via a **public IP**, traffic flows through a **private IP** inside your VNet.
* Uses **Azure Private Link** technology.

---

# 🛠 How It Works

1. You create a **Private Endpoint** for a resource (like a Storage Account).
2. Azure assigns a **private IP** from your VNet to this endpoint.
3. Your VNet traffic → goes through this private IP → securely reaches the Azure service → without leaving Microsoft’s backbone network.
4. The service’s **public endpoint is still there**, but you can restrict/block it.

# 📂 Example: Azure Storage with Private Endpoint

* You have a Storage Account `mystorage.blob.core.windows.net`.
* Normally, you’d connect via the public internet using that FQDN.
* With a **Private Endpoint**, Azure will map:

```
mystorage.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net → 10.1.0.5  (private IP inside your VNet)
```

* So apps in your VNet access Storage **via private IP**.
* You can then **disable all public access** to the Storage Account for max security.

# ✅ Benefits

* **Security**: No public internet exposure.
* **Compliance**: Meets strict data residency/security requirements.
* **Integration**: Works with Azure PaaS (Storage, SQL, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, etc.) and your own services behind Azure Standard Load Balancer.

# ⚙️ Configuration Steps (High-Level)

1. **Create a VNet & Subnet**.
2. **Create a Private Endpoint**:

   * Choose target service (e.g., Storage Account → Blob).
   * Pick the VNet + subnet.
   * A NIC with private IP gets created.
3. **Update DNS**:

   * Ensure the service FQDN resolves to the private IP (via Azure Private DNS Zone).
4. **Restrict Public Access**:

   * Disable public network access on the resource.

# 🚀 Azure CLI Example

```bash
# Create Private Endpoint for Storage Account
az network private-endpoint create \
  --name mystorage-pe \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --subnet mySubnet \
  --private-connection-resource-id $(az storage account show -n mystorage -g myResourceGroup --query id -o tsv) \
  --group-id blob \
  --connection-name mystorage-connection

# Link Private DNS Zone
az network private-dns zone create -g myResourceGroup -n "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"
az network private-dns link vnet create -g myResourceGroup -n "link-myvnet" -z "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net" -v myVNet -e true
```

# 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

* Connect Azure SQL Database from on-prem → via ExpressRoute/VPN + private endpoint (no internet).
* Secure Azure Storage for Databricks / Synapse pipelines.
* Access Key Vault privately from inside a VNet.
