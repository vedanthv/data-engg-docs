## Kafka : Consuming Records with Specific Offset

Sure — let’s go through this step by step and unpack the meaning of that paragraph in detail.

---

### **1. Default Consumer Behavior**

When you use the Kafka Consumer API, you usually call:

```java
consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
```

Each time you call `poll()`, Kafka starts reading messages **from the last committed offset** for each partition that your consumer is assigned to.

* The **offset** is a numerical position within a Kafka partition.
* The **committed offset** is the last message position your consumer group marked as “processed.”

So, by default, Kafka resumes consumption **exactly where it left off** — ensuring no messages are skipped or reprocessed.

---

### **2. Starting from a Different Offset**

Sometimes, you might not want to start reading from the last committed position. You may want to:

* Reprocess **all messages** from the beginning.
* Skip to the **most recent messages** only.
* Or start at an **exact offset** you specify.

Kafka provides APIs that allow you to manually control **where** the consumer begins reading.

---

### **3. `seekToBeginning()`**

If you want to read **all messages** in a partition — from the very first offset — you can use:

```java
consumer.seekToBeginning(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions);
```

**What happens:**

* This tells Kafka to move the consumer’s position to the **earliest offset** available in the log for each partition in the list.
* On the next `poll()`, Kafka will start returning messages from the **oldest record** onward.

**Use case example:**

* You’re debugging or replaying historical data.
* You want to rebuild a downstream database or reprocess all records.

---

### **4. `seekToEnd()`**

If you only care about **new messages** that arrive **after** you start consuming, use:

```java
consumer.seekToEnd(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions);
```

**What happens:**

* This moves the consumer’s position to the **latest offset** in each partition.
* On the next `poll()`, Kafka will start returning **only new messages** published after this point.

**Use case example:**

* You’re monitoring live events and only want real-time updates, not historical data.

---

### **5. `seek()` — Moving to a Specific Offset**

For even more control, you can use:

```java
consumer.seek(TopicPartition partition, long offset);
```

This allows you to position the consumer **exactly at a specific offset**.

**What happens:**

* You manually tell Kafka which record position to start from.
* On the next `poll()`, consumption begins from that offset.

**Use case examples:**

1. **Recovery scenario** — if your application crashed while writing data to a file, you can restart it and `seek()` back to the last successfully written offset.
2. **Skipping stale data** — if you detect that you’re falling behind, you can `seek()` ahead to a newer offset and catch up faster.
3. **Time-based replay** — with the help of `offsetsForTimes()`, you can find the offset corresponding to a timestamp, then use `seek()` to start from that point.

---

### **6. When These APIs Are Useful**

These APIs are particularly useful when:

* You manage offsets **manually** instead of relying on Kafka’s automatic commits.
* You need **custom recovery or replay logic**.
* You are building tools for **data reprocessing**, **debugging**, or **time-travel** (reading old events).

---

### **7. Important Note**

After you use `seekToBeginning()`, `seekToEnd()`, or `seek()`, the new position takes effect **only for the next call to `poll()`**.
Kafka will not commit this new position automatically — you must commit offsets yourself (using `commitSync()` or `commitAsync()`) if you want Kafka to remember your new starting point for the next session.

### **Summary**

| Method              | What It Does                           | When to Use                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `seekToBeginning()` | Start reading from the earliest offset | Replay all data              |
| `seekToEnd()`       | Skip to the latest offset              | Only process new messages    |
| `seek()`            | Jump to a specific offset              | Custom replay/recovery logic |
