## Indexes in Kafka

Kafka allows consumers to start fetching messages from any available offset. This means that if a consumer asks for 1 MB messages starting at offset 100, the broker must be able to quickly locate the message for offset 100 (which can be in any of the segments for the partition) and start reading the messages from that offset on. In order to help brokers quickly locate the message for a given offset, Kafka maintains an index for each partition. The index maps offsets to segment files and positions within the file. Similarly, Kafka has a second index that maps timestamps to message offsets. 

This index is used when searching for messages by timestamp. Kafka Streams uses this lookup extensively, and it is also useful in some failover scenarios. Indexes are also broken into segments, so we can delete old index entries when the messages are purged. 

Kafka does not attempt to maintain checksums of the index. If the index becomes corrupted, it will get regenerated from the matching log segment simply by rereading the messages and recording the offsets and locations. It is also completely safe (albeit, it can cause a lengthy recovery) for an administrator to delete index segments if neededâ€”they will be regenerated automatically.
