## Explain How Streaming Data from Disk to Exector works for SMJ?

## 🔹 Sort-Merge Join Execution (with skew + spill)

1. **Both sides sorted & partitioned**

   * Table A (smaller side) → all rows sorted by key.
   * Table B (skewed side) → rows also sorted by key, but because the skewed key is huge, Spark may spill a lot of its sorted chunks to disk.

2. **Executor merge phase**

   * Spark creates iterators:

     * One for **A** (fits in memory).
     * One for **B** (some in memory, some spilled to disk).

3. **When join key is encountered**

   * Spark buffers **all rows for that key from A** (usually small enough to keep in memory).
   * Spark starts pulling **rows for that key from B** in **batches**.

     * If the rows are in memory, read directly.
     * If rows were spilled, load them back sequentially from disk (streaming).

4. **Join output**

   * For each batch of rows from B, Spark does the **Cartesian product** with A’s buffered rows.
   * Emits results in a streaming fashion.
   * If B’s key group is gigantic, Spark keeps pulling more batches from disk until all pairs are produced.

---

## 🔹 Key Insight

* Spark **never tries to load all of skewed table B into memory** at once.
* Instead:

  * **A is small** → fully in memory.
  * **B is big** → read batch → join with A → emit results → read next batch → repeat.
* If B is insanely large, Spark may spill intermediate join buffers again, but the logic is still **stream & spill**, not “load all at once.”

---

## 🔹 Analogy

Imagine:

* Table A = a **tiny bowl of 5 apples** 🍎.
* Table B = a **giant truckload of apples** 🚚.
* Spark doesn’t dump the whole truck into memory.
* Instead, it **unloads one crate at a time**, joins with the 5 apples from A, writes results out, and then grabs the next crate.

---

✅ **So yes, exactly**: executor keeps small table A in memory, and streams batches of rows for the skewed key from table B (from memory and disk), joining them incrementally.

👉 Do you want me to also explain what happens in the **opposite case** (when both A and B are huge and skewed)? That’s where Spark can still OOM despite spilling.
