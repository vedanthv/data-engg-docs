### Delta Live Tables : Batch vs Streaming Workloads

Here’s a detailed breakdown of **batch vs streaming workloads for Delta Live Tables (DLT) streaming table sources** and when to use each:

---

## **1. Conceptual Difference**

| Aspect               | Batch Workload                                          | Streaming Workload                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Processing**  | Processes a finite dataset at once.                     | Continuously processes new data as it arrives.                   |
| **Latency**          | High (runs periodically).                               | Low (near real-time).                                            |
| **Trigger**          | Manual or scheduled (e.g., daily, hourly).              | Continuous / micro-batches.                                      |
| **State Management** | Not required; table is fully recomputed or append-only. | Required; DLT tracks which data has already been processed.      |
| **Use Cases**        | Historical analytics, daily aggregates, backfills.      | Real-time dashboards, alerts, event processing, fraud detection. |

## **2. How DLT Handles Sources**

DLT streaming table sources can come from:

1. **Streaming sources**

   * Kafka, Event Hubs, cloud storage (`cloudFiles`), Delta tables.
   * Automatically **incremental**, supports schema evolution.
   * Example (Python):

   ```python
   @dlt.table
   def streaming_sales():
       return (
           spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles")
                .option("cloudFiles.format", "json")
                .load("/mnt/sales/json")
       )
   ```

2. **Batch sources**

   * Existing Delta tables, Parquet, CSV, or JDBC.
   * DLT can treat these as **batch reads** if no streaming input is detected.
   * Example (Python):

   ```python
   @dlt.table
   def daily_sales():
       return spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/sales/delta")
   ```

> DLT automatically detects whether the source is streaming or batch, but you can explicitly control behavior with `spark.readStream` vs `spark.read`.

## **3. Streaming Table Behavior in DLT**

| Feature                    | Behavior for Batch Sources                                   | Behavior for Streaming Sources                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incremental Processing** | Only new runs; full dataset read each time unless optimized. | DLT tracks offsets/checkpoints to process only new data.                                  |
| **State Management**       | Not needed.                                                  | DLT maintains state to support upserts, aggregations, joins.                              |
| **Dependencies**           | Upstream changes processed on next pipeline run.             | Changes propagate continuously downstream (materialized views get updated incrementally). |
| **Latency**                | Minutes to hours (depends on schedule).                      | Seconds to minutes (micro-batch).                                                         |
| **Use Case in DLT**        | Backfill historical data, batch pipelines.                   | Real-time dashboards, streaming aggregations, event-driven analytics.                     |

## **4. Choosing Between Batch and Streaming**

| Scenario                                                | Preferred Workload                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Daily sales report from last month                      | Batch                                              |
| Real-time fraud detection on transactions               | Streaming                                          |
| Hourly ETL from a static CSV dump                       | Batch                                              |
| Continuous clickstream analytics for dashboards         | Streaming                                          |
| Incremental aggregation from an append-only Delta table | Can be either, depending on freshness requirements |

### **5. Practical Notes for DLT**

1. **Streaming tables can consume batch data**

   * You can define a streaming table that reads from a Delta table (`spark.readStream.format("delta")`), so it behaves like streaming even if the upstream table is batch.
2. **Materialized views downstream**

   * Always incremental; DLT ensures updates propagate automatically.
3. **Checkpointing**

   * DLT automatically handles checkpoints for streaming sources. You don’t need to manage offsets manually.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* **Batch workloads** → finite, scheduled processing.
* **Streaming workloads** → continuous, low-latency processing with state management.
* **DLT streaming tables** adapt to both but are most powerful when the source is streaming.
