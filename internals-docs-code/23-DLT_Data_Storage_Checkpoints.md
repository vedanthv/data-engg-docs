## Data Storage Internals, Checkpoints and Renaming Streaming Tables and Views

Here’s a detailed explanation of **how Delta Live Tables (DLT) handles storage for streaming tables, pipeline dependency, and renaming behavior**:

---

## **1. Where is data for streaming tables stored?**

* **Streaming tables in DLT are stored as Delta tables on the Databricks File System (DBFS) or your cloud storage configured for the pipeline**, e.g., **S3, ADLS Gen2, or GCS**.
* Every streaming table has a **physical Delta table location**, even though you define it declaratively in DLT.
* The storage location is typically **managed by the DLT pipeline**, but you can explicitly configure it in advanced pipeline settings.

**Key points:**

* **Incremental state** (processed offsets, checkpoints) is stored in **\_system-managed checkpoints** within the pipeline’s storage path.
* **Upserts and merges** are persisted in the Delta table itself.
* **Data retention** and compaction follow normal Delta table rules.

## **2. Is storage dependent on the pipeline?**

Yes, partially:

* **Pipeline-specific storage**:
  Each DLT pipeline manages its own metadata and checkpoints for the streaming tables it owns.
* **Shared tables**:
  If multiple pipelines reference the same Delta table (e.g., using `LIVE.<table_name>`), the physical Delta table is **shared**, but each pipeline maintains its own lineage and state metadata.

**Implication:**

* Deleting a pipeline **does not delete the underlying Delta table** automatically, unless you explicitly choose managed tables.
* Changing pipelines (like moving a table to a different pipeline) requires careful handling to avoid breaking downstream dependencies.

## **3. What happens when we rename streaming tables?**

* **DLT does not support a “rename” operation in place** for streaming tables.
* If you rename a table in DLT:

  1. The new table name points to a **new managed object** in the pipeline.
  2. The **underlying Delta data is copied or remapped** depending on configuration.
  3. Any downstream references (`LIVE.<old_name>`) break unless you **update them to the new name**.
* **Best practice:**

  * Avoid renaming streaming tables in active pipelines.
  * If renaming is needed, **create a new table with the desired name** and **point downstream materialized views or pipelines** to it.

## **4. Practical Notes / Recommendations**

| Aspect              | Recommendation                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage             | Let DLT manage default Delta table locations unless you need a custom path.                                |
| Pipeline dependency | Be aware that streaming tables are tied to pipeline metadata (checkpoints, lineage).                       |
| Renaming            | Prefer creating a new table and updating downstream references; avoid in-place renames for live pipelines. |
| Backup              | If renaming or moving, snapshot or backup Delta tables to avoid data loss.                                 |

✅ **Summary:**

1. Streaming tables **always persist data as Delta tables** in the pipeline’s storage.
2. Storage and checkpoints are **pipeline-dependent**, but the data itself can be shared.
3. **Renaming a streaming table breaks dependencies**; best approach is to create a new table instead of renaming.
