# 🌐 Introduction to Azure Data Factory (ADF)

### 🔹 What is ADF?

Azure Data Factory is **Microsoft’s cloud-based ETL & data integration service**.
Think of it as a **factory for moving and transforming data** across different systems, both on-premises and in the cloud.

It’s a **serverless** service (you don’t manage servers), and it allows you to build **data pipelines** that automate data movement, ingestion, and transformation.

### 🔹 Why ADF?

* Companies often have data scattered across:

  * Databases (SQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  * Files (CSV, JSON, Parquet in blob storage, data lake, S3, etc.)
  * SaaS apps (Salesforce, SAP, Dynamics, etc.)
* ADF connects these sources, moves data, and transforms it into a structured form for reporting, analytics, or AI/ML.

### 🔹 Core Concepts

1. **Pipelines**

   * A pipeline = **workflow** that defines a series of activities (like copying, transforming, loading).
   * Example: Extract data from SQL → Transform in Databricks → Load into Synapse.

2. **Activities**

   * Steps inside a pipeline.
   * Types:

     * **Data movement**: Copy data from source to sink.
     * **Data transformation**: Run Databricks notebooks, Spark jobs, SQL scripts.
     * **Control**: Loops, conditions, wait, execute another pipeline.

3. **Datasets**

   * Represent the **data structure** (like a table, a file path, or a folder).
   * Example: A dataset could point to a CSV file in Azure Blob Storage.

4. **Linked Services**

   * Connection information (credentials, endpoints).
   * Example: Linked service for Azure SQL DB, one for Data Lake.

5. **Integration Runtime (IR)**

   * The **compute infrastructure** ADF uses to move/transform data.
   * Types:

     * **Azure IR**: Fully managed in the cloud (default).
     * **Self-hosted IR**: For connecting on-prem systems.
     * **SSIS IR**: For running SSIS packages.

### 🔹 Common Use Cases

* **ETL / ELT pipelines**
  Ingest raw data → transform into clean data → load into data warehouse (like Synapse or Snowflake).
* **Data Lake Ingestion**
  Collect logs/files into Azure Data Lake Gen2.
* **Hybrid Data Movement**
  Move data from on-prem SQL Server to Azure Synapse.
* **Big Data Integration**
  Orchestrate Databricks notebooks, Spark, or HDInsight.
* **Scheduling & Monitoring**
  Automate jobs, monitor them with logs and alerts.

---

### 🔹 Example Workflow

1. Copy sales data from **on-prem SQL Server** into **Azure Data Lake** daily.
2. Trigger a **Databricks notebook** to clean and enrich the data.
3. Load processed data into **Azure Synapse Analytics**.
4. Business analysts connect Power BI → create dashboards.

---

### 🔹 Benefits

* **Serverless** → no infra to manage.
* **Scalable** → works for small files or terabytes.
* **Cost-effective** → pay-per-use.
* **Rich connectors** → 100+ sources (DBs, files, APIs).
* **Visual & code-based** → drag-and-drop UI + JSON definitions.
* **Monitoring** → built-in logging, retry, alerts.

👉 In short:
ADF = **a data pipeline orchestration tool in Azure**.
It moves, transforms, and organizes data so that downstream systems (like Synapse, Databricks, Power BI) can use it.
