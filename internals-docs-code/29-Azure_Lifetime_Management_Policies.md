## 🔹 What is a Lifecycle Management Policy?

A **lifecycle management policy** in Azure Storage is a set of **rules that automatically move or delete blob data** based on conditions you define (like age, last access, or storage tier).

👉 Think of it like a **cleaning robot** for your storage:

* Move old files to cheaper storage (Cool / Archive).
* Delete files after X days.
* Keep only recently accessed data hot.

---

## 🔹 Why use it?

* Save money 💰 by moving rarely used data to **Cool** or **Archive** tiers.
* Automatically clean up expired or obsolete data.
* Enforce compliance (e.g., delete logs after 365 days).

---

## 🔹 What can a policy do?

You define **rules** with filters and actions.

### **Filters** (what data is affected)

* **Blob type**: block blob, append blob.
* **Container or blob prefix**: apply to a specific container or folder-like path.
* **Blob index tags**: apply only to blobs matching certain key-value tags.

### **Conditions** (when to act)

* `daysSinceModificationGreaterThan` → based on **last modified date**.
* `daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan` → based on **last access date** (requires last access tracking).

### **Actions** (what to do)

* Move to a different **tier**: Hot → Cool → Archive.
* Delete the blob.
* Delete blob snapshots or versions.

---

## 🔹 Example Scenarios

1. **Archive old data**

   * Move blobs older than 90 days to Archive.

2. **Delete stale logs**

   * Delete blobs older than 365 days in `logs/` container.

3. **Tier by access**

   * If not accessed for 30 days → move to Cool.
   * If not accessed for 180 days → move to Archive.

## 🔹 Example Policy (JSON)

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "archiveOldLogs",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["logs/"]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {
              "daysSinceModificationGreaterThan": 30
            },
            "tierToArchive": {
              "daysSinceModificationGreaterThan": 90
            },
            "delete": {
              "daysSinceModificationGreaterThan": 365
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔹 How to configure

1. **Azure Portal**

   * Storage Account → **Data Management** → **Lifecycle Management** → Add rule.

2. **Azure CLI**

```sh
az storage account management-policy create \
  --account-name mystorageacct \
  --resource-group myRG \
  --policy @policy.json
```

3. **ARM Template / Terraform**

   * Infrastructure-as-code way to apply lifecycle policies.

---

## 🔹 Best Practices

* Use **prefixes** (like `logs/`, `archive/`) to separate hot vs cold data.
* Turn on **last access tracking** if you want rules based on read activity (but note it adds metadata overhead).
* Test rules with **simulation** (in Portal) before applying at scale.
* Use **different tiers** (Hot, Cool, Archive) strategically for cost optimization.

---

✅ **Summary**:
Lifecycle management policies = automatic rules that **move or delete blobs** based on age or last access, helping with cost savings and compliance.

### Immutable Blob Storage (WORM) vs Lifecycle Managmeent Policies

---

## 🔹 1. Lifecycle Management Policies

* **Goal**: **Cost optimization + cleanup**.
* **What it does**:

  * Moves blobs between tiers (Hot → Cool → Archive).
  * Deletes blobs after X days or if unused.
* **Control**: You define JSON rules with conditions like last modified or last accessed time.
* **Flexibility**: You can change or remove policies anytime.
* **Use case**:

  * Logs older than 30 days → Cool tier.
  * Logs older than 365 days → Delete.

👉 Think: *“Move old clothes to the attic, throw them away after a year.”*

---

## 🔹 2. Immutable Blob Storage (WORM = Write Once, Read Many)

* **Goal**: **Compliance + data protection**.
* **What it does**:

  * Locks blobs for a retention period (days to years).
  * Prevents deletion or overwrite (even by admins).
* **Control**:

  * **Time-based retention** → e.g., “Keep for 7 years.”
  * **Legal hold** → indefinite retention until manually cleared.
* **Flexibility**: Once a retention policy is **locked**, it cannot be shortened (only extended).
* **Use case**:

  * Financial records retention for 7 years.
  * Healthcare data that cannot be altered.

👉 Think: *“Put important documents in a sealed safe. You can read them, but not shred them until the timer expires.”*

## 🔹 Key Differences

| Feature              | Lifecycle Management              | Immutable Storage                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Cost savings, cleanup             | Compliance, data protection                             |
| **Action**           | Move, delete, tier data           | Prevent delete/overwrite                                |
| **Control**          | JSON policy (flexible, editable)  | Retention lock (WORM)                                   |
| **Who can override** | Admins can always change policies | Nobody (not even account owner) until retention expires |
| **Use case**         | Log cleanup, archive old data     | Legal/financial records, regulatory compliance          |
| **Risk if misused**  | Could delete important data       | Could lock data forever, increasing cost                |

---

## 🔹 How they work together

* You **cannot apply lifecycle deletion** to blobs under immutable retention (deletion will fail).
* But you can **tier** immutable blobs (e.g., keep in Archive tier for cost savings).

---

✅ **Summary**

* **Lifecycle Policies** = *cost management tool*.
* **Immutable Storage** = *compliance + legal protection tool*.
* Both are about data aging, but **Lifecycle = flexible cleanup**, **Immutable = strict lock-down**.
