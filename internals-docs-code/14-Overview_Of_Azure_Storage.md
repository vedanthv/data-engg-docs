### Overview of Azure Storage

---

# 🔹 What is Azure Storage?

Azure Storage is Microsoft’s **cloud-based storage platform**, providing highly available, durable, and secure storage for **blobs, files, queues, and tables**.

Think of it like a **giant hard drive in the cloud**, but with specialized “drawers” for different types of data.

# 🔹 Core Types of Azure Storage

1. **Blob Storage (Data Lake Gen2)**

   * Stores **unstructured data**: text, images, video, JSON, Parquet, CSV.
   * Supports **HDFS-like hierarchical namespace (HNS)** when enabled → required for **Data Lake Gen2**.
   * Used for:

     * Data lakes (ETL, big data, analytics).
     * Storing files for machine learning.
     * Backups, archives.
   * Example: `abfss://container@account.dfs.core.windows.net/`

---

2. **File Storage (Azure Files)**

   * Fully managed **file shares** accessible via **SMB/NFS**.
   * Used when apps expect a **network file share**.
   * Example use cases:

     * Lift-and-shift legacy apps that require shared drives.
     * Store config files for apps running in Azure VMs or Kubernetes.

---

3. **Queue Storage**

   * Stores **messages** that applications can send and receive asynchronously.
   * Each message up to **64 KB**.
   * Used for **decoupling applications** (producer/consumer).
   * Example: A web app puts a message in a queue, and a background worker picks it up for processing.

---

4. **Table Storage (or Cosmos DB Table API)**

   * NoSQL key-value store.
   * Stores structured, non-relational data.
   * Example: IoT telemetry, user profiles, metadata.

# 🔹 Storage Account Types

When you create a **Storage Account** in Azure, you’re creating a **top-level container** for these services.

Types:

1. **General-purpose v2 (GPv2)** → recommended, supports blobs, files, queues, tables, Data Lake Gen2.
2. **Blob storage account** → specialized for blobs.
3. **Premium storage** → optimized for low-latency scenarios (SSD-backed).

# 🔹 Key Features

* **Redundancy (Replication)**:

  * LRS (Locally redundant).
  * ZRS (Zone redundant).
  * GRS (Geo-redundant).
  * RA-GRS (Geo + Read access).
* **Security**:

  * RBAC + IAM.
  * SAS tokens (time-limited access).
  * Integration with Azure AD (Managed Identities).
* **Lifecycle Management**:

  * Move data between hot → cool → archive tiers automatically.
* **Encryption**:

  * All data encrypted at rest (Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys).

# 🔹 Example: Data Engineer Workflow

Let’s say you’re building a pipeline with **Databricks + Delta Lake**:

1. Create a **Storage Account** with HNS enabled (for ADLS Gen2).
2. Create a **container** (`bronze`, `silver`, `gold`).
3. Upload raw CSVs to `bronze`.
4. Mount storage in Databricks (via **Managed Identity + UC external location**).
5. Write cleaned Delta tables to `silver`.
6. Curated aggregates go to `gold`.

👉 This setup is the **lakehouse pattern**.

# 🔹 Quick Analogy

* **Storage Account** = the house.
* **Container (Blob)** = big room in the house.
* **Folder** = cabinet inside the room.
* **File (Blob object)** = actual book/document.
* **RBAC/SAS** = the keys to the house/room.
